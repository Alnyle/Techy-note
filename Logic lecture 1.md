#### premises
A premise is what forms the basis of a theory or a plot.

When you called 911 on the guy in your back yard, it was on the premise that he was a thief and not the meter-reader

### Rules of Inference

****Rules of Inference:**** Rules of inference are logical tools used to derive conclusions from premises. They form the foundation of logical reasoning, allowing us to build arguments, prove theorems, and solve problems in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. Understanding these rules is crucial for constructing valid arguments and ensuring that conclusions follow logically from given information.

In other logic, each rule of inference leads to a specific conclusion based on given premises.


### Logic symbols

Logic symbols are the symbols used to represent logic in mathematics. There are multiple logic symbols including quantifiers, connectives and other symbols. In this article we will explore all the logic symbols that are useful to represent logical statements in mathematical form. Let's start our learning on the topic "Logic Symbols."

The symbols that are used to represent logical statements are called logic symbols. The logic symbols help to convert English statements in the form of mathematical logic. The two main types of mathematical logic are [propositional logic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/proposition-logic/) and predicate logic. In propositional logic, connective logic symbols are mainly used whereas in predicate logic quantifiers logic symbols are used along with the connectives.

Commonly used logic symbols can either be classified as:

- Quantifiers
- Connectives

Focus on **Connectives symbols** [reference]([List of all Logic Symbols - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logic-symbols/))

| **Symbol** | Name        | Meaning                      | Example                    |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **¬**      | Negation    | Negation (NOT)               | ¬p (not p)                 |
| **∧**      | Conjunction | Conjunction (AND)            | p ∧ q (p and q)            |
| *∨*        | Disjunction | Disjunction (OR)             | p ∨ q (p or q)             |
| *→ or ⇒*   | Implication | Implication (IF...THEN)      | p → q (if p, then q)       |
| **↔ or ⇔** | Equivalence | Equivalence (IF AND ONLY IF) | p ↔ q (p if and only if q) |

### Propositional Logic

Proposition It is defined as a declarative sentence that is either True or False, but not both
or
proposition is statements that can be evaluated as true or false
## Types of Propositions

In propositional logic, propositions are statements that can be evaluated as true or false. They are the building blocks of more complex logical statements. Here’s a breakdown of the two main types of propositions:

- Atomic Propositions
- Compound Propositions


# Logical Entailment

Logical entailment is a fundamental concept in formal logic that describes a relationship between statements or propositions where one statement necessarily follows from another. In other words, if a set of premises logically entails a conclusion, then if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This relationship is crucial in understanding how arguments work and in evaluating their validity, particularly through laws of logical equivalence.

1. Logical entailment is often symbolized as 'A ⊨ B', meaning 'A entails B'.
2. It is not just about correlation; if the premises are true, the conclusion must hold under all interpretations.
3. Entailment can be evaluated using truth tables or logical proofs to determine whether a conclusion follows from premises.
4. In propositional logic, understanding entailment helps clarify which conclusions can be drawn based on given premises.
5. Logical entailment plays a vital role in formal systems, allowing mathematicians and philosophers to build rigorous arguments.
