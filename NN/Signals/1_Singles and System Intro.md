### Mathematically:

The signal is a function of one or more independent variable that maps a domain, often time or space, into a range, often a physical measure such as air pressure or light intensity. We usually called the independent variable time even if it is not actually time


##### explanation:

Mathematically, a signal can be understood as a function that maps from an independent variable (or set of variables) to some dependent variable. The independent variable is often referred to as "time" (especially in the context of time-domain signals), but it can represent other dimensions as well, such as space or frequency.

Formally, if x(t) represents a signal, then t is typically considered the independent variable, which could represent time, space, etc., while xxx is the dependent variable, representing a physical quantity like air pressure (in the case of sound) or light intensity (in the case of an optical signal).

For example:

- In audio processing, t could represent time and x(t) could represent air pressure variations.
- In image processing, the independent variables could be two spatial coordinates (e.g., x and y), while the signal could be light intensity at different points.

This abstraction helps in the analysis of different types of signals across various domains.

### System

A system, in the context of signals and systems theory, is essentially a transformation or a function that takes an input signal (from its domain, called the input signal space) and produces an output signal (in its range, called the output signal space). The domain and range here are both spaces composed of signals, and these spaces are referred to as **signal spaces**.

So, a system can be formally represented as:

						  $S:Xâ†’Y$


Where:
- S is the system.
- X is the input signal space (domain).
- Y is the output signal space (range).
- 
In simpler terms, a system can be seen as a mapping rule that transforms an input signal (or set of signals) into corresponding output signals based on certain operations or transformations defined by the system.

Systems can be classified into different types, such as linear vs. nonlinear, time-invariant vs. time-variant, causal vs. non-causal, etc., depending on their properties and behavior.
