Arrays.stream(context.getBeanDefinitionNames()).forEach(System.out::println); explain to me

The code snippet you provided is written in Java and is typically used in the context of a Spring application. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. `context.getBeanDefinitionNames()`

- **`context`**: This represents the Spring application context, which is the central interface to the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. The context is responsible for managing all the beans (i.e., objects) in the Spring application.
- **`getBeanDefinitionNames()`**: This method retrieves the names of all the bean definitions registered in the Spring application context. A "bean" in Spring is essentially an object that is managed by the Spring container.

### 2. `Arrays.stream(context.getBeanDefinitionNames())`

- **`Arrays.stream(...)`**: This converts the array of bean names into a stream. A stream in Java is a sequence of elements that can be processed in a functional style, allowing for operations such as filtering, mapping, and iterating.

### 3. `.forEach(System.out::println)`

- **`forEach(...)`**: This is a terminal operation on the stream that applies a given action to each element of the stream. In this case, it prints each bean name.
- **`System.out::println`**: This is a method reference in Java, which is shorthand for a lambda expression. It means "for each element in the stream, pass it to the `println` method of `System.out`," effectively printing each bean name to the console.

### Overall Explanation

This code will print out the names of all the beans (objects) that have been defined and managed by the Spring application context. It's often used for debugging purposes to check which beans are currently being managed by the Spring container.

For example, if you have a Spring application with beans such as `UserService`, `ProductRepository`, and `OrderController`, their names would be printed to the console when this code is executed.
