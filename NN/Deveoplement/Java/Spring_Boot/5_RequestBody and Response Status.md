`@RequestBody` is an annotation in Spring Framework (typically used in Spring MVC and Spring Boot) that is applied to method parameters in controller classes. It indicates that the method parameter should be bound to the body of the HTTP request. In other words, it tells Spring to convert the incoming JSON (or other data formats like XML) in the request body into a Java object using an appropriate message converter.

### Example:

java

Copy code

@RestController
public class UserController {

    @PostMapping("/createUser")
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        // The user object is automatically populated with data from the request body
        return ResponseEntity.ok(user);
    }
}

### How It Works:

1. **Client Request**: The client sends an HTTP POST request to the `/createUser` endpoint with a JSON payload in the body:
    
    json
    
    Copy code
    
    `{     "name": "John",     "age": 30 }`
    
2. **Spring Conversion**: Spring uses the `@RequestBody` annotation to automatically convert this JSON into a `User` object.
    
3. **Controller Method**: The `User` object is passed to the `createUser` method, where you can manipulate it as needed.
    

### Key Points:

- **Automatic Conversion**: Spring uses message converters (like `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` for JSON) to handle the conversion.
- **Validation**: You can combine `@RequestBody` with validation annotations (e.g., `@Valid`) to validate the incoming request data.
- **HTTP Methods**: `@RequestBody` is typically used with HTTP methods that have a body, such as POST, PUT, or PATCH.


### Response Status code

The first line of your code snippet:

`@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)`  
`@PostMapping("")`  
`public void create(@RequestBody Content content) {`  
    `repository.save(content);`  
`}`

`@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)`

is an annotation in Spring that indicates the HTTP status code that should be returned to the client after the request is successfully processed.

### Explanation:

- **`@ResponseStatus`**: This annotation is used at the method level to specify the HTTP status code that should be returned when the method completes successfully.
    
- **`HttpStatus.CREATED`**: This is an enum value representing the HTTP status code `201 Created`. The `201 Created` status code is typically used in response to a `POST` request, indicating that a new resource has been successfully created on the server.
    

### How It Works in Context:

When the `create` method in your controller is called and the `Content` object is successfully saved to the repository, Spring will automatically send an HTTP response with the status code `201 Created`. This informs the client that the creation of the resource (in this case, the `Content`) was successful.

If you didn't specify `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)`, Spring would return the default status code for a successful request, which is usually `200 OK`. By explicitly setting it to `201 Created`, you align the response with standard REST practices.
