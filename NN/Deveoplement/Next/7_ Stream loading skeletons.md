A loading skeleton is a simplified version of the UI. Many websites use them as a placeholder (or fallback) to indicate to users that the content is loading. Any UI you add in `loading.tsx` will be embedded as part of the static file, and sent first. Then, the rest of the dynamic content will be streamed from the server to the client.

### [Fixing the loading skeleton bug with route groups](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/streaming#fixing-the-loading-skeleton-bug-with-route-groups)

Right now, your loading skeleton will apply to the invoices and customers pages as well.

Since `loading.tsx` is a level higher than `/invoices/page.tsx` and `/customers/page.tsx` in the file system, it's also applied to those pages.

We can change this with [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups). Create a new folder called `/(overview)` inside the dashboard folder. Then, move your `loading.tsx` and `page.tsx` files inside the folder:

![[route-group.avif]]

Now, the `loading.tsx` file will only apply to your dashboard overview page.

Route groups allow you to organize files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure. When you create a new folder using parentheses `()`, the name won't be included in the URL path. So `/dashboard/(overview)/page.tsx` becomes `/dashboard`.

Here, you're using a route group to ensure `loading.tsx` only applies to your dashboard overview page. However, you can also use route groups to separate your application into sections (e.g. `(marketing)` routes and `(shop)` routes) or by teams for larger applications.

## [Deciding where to place your Suspense boundaries](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/streaming#deciding-where-to-place-your-suspense-boundaries)

Where you place your Suspense boundaries will depend on a few things:

1. How you want the user to experience the page as it streams.
2. What content you want to prioritize.
3. If the components rely on data fetching.

Take a look at your dashboard page, is there anything you would've done differently?

Don't worry. There isn't a right answer.

- You could stream the **whole page** like we did with `loading.tsx`... but that may lead to a longer loading time if one of the components has a slow data fetch.
- You could stream **every component** individually... but that may lead to UI _popping_ into the screen as it becomes ready.
- You could also create a _staggered_ effect by streaming **page sections**. But you'll need to create wrapper components.

Where you place your suspense boundaries will vary depending on your application. In general, it's good practice to move your data fetches down to the components that need it, and then wrap those components in Suspense. But there is nothing wrong with streaming the sections or the whole page if that's what your application needs.

Don't be afraid to experiment with Suspense and see what works best, it's a powerful API that can help you create more delightful user experiences.
