When you use **Amazon EC2 Spot Instances**, you can define a **maximum spot price** you're willing to pay for the instance. Spot instances take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at a discounted rate, but the hourly spot price varies based on supply and demand for EC2 resources. Here’s how the process works:

### Spot Price and Maximum Price:

- **Spot Price**: This is the current market price for Spot Instances. It fluctuates over time based on demand and available capacity.
- **Max Spot Price**: When launching a Spot Instance, you can define the maximum price you're willing to pay. If the current spot price is below your maximum, the instance will be launched and run.

### Behavior When Spot Price Increases:

- If the **current spot price exceeds your maximum spot price**, your instance may be interrupted.
- **Two-Minute Grace Period**: When the spot price goes above your maximum, AWS gives a 2-minute notice before stopping or terminating the instance. During this time, you can save data or gracefully shut down processes.

You can choose one of two actions when this happens:

1. **Stop** the instance: This will save your instance’s state, allowing you to start it later when the spot price falls below your maximum price.
2. **Terminate** the instance: This will delete the instance entirely.

### Spot Block (Defined Duration Instances):

- **Spot Block** is a different strategy where you can **“block”** or reserve a Spot Instance for a specified period, typically between **1 to 6 hours**, without interruptions.
- This guarantees the instance won't be interrupted within the specified time, making it more reliable for short, predictable workloads.

However, in **rare situations**, such as a capacity shortfall or other operational issues, AWS may reclaim the Spot Block instance even within the specified duration, although this is not common.

### Summary of Strategies:

- **Max Spot Price**: Set the maximum price you’re willing to pay, and AWS will run the instance as long as the spot price is below that. If the spot price rises above your max, AWS provides a 2-minute grace period to stop or terminate the instance.
- **Spot Block**: Reserve a Spot Instance for 1 to 6 hours, where AWS guarantees no interruptions for that period, with the rare possibility of reclamation.

This setup helps you balance cost savings with the risk of instance interruptions, giving you flexibility for managing workload reliability.

### Spot Fleets

**Amazon EC2 Spot Fleets** are a powerful feature that allow you to automatically manage a fleet of **Spot Instances** and, optionally, **On-Demand Instances** to meet your application's capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost. Here's a detailed explanation of how Spot Fleets work:

### Overview:

A **Spot Fleet** is essentially a collection of Spot Instances (and optionally On-Demand Instances) that automatically adjusts to meet the **target capacity** you set. The fleet continuously evaluates available resources and spot prices to launch instances from various "launch pools" you define.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Target Capacity**: The number of instances or vCPUs (virtual CPUs) you want to run in total.
    
2. **Launch Pools**: These are sets of instance types, operating systems (OS), and availability zones from which the Spot Fleet can choose to launch instances. For example, a launch pool might include:
    
    - Instance types (e.g., `m5.large`, `c5.large`)
    - Operating systems (e.g., Linux, Windows)
    - Availability zones (e.g., `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`)
    
    You can define multiple launch pools so the fleet has multiple options and can balance cost, availability, and capacity.
    
3. **Price Constraints**: You can specify price limits for Spot Instances, ensuring that the fleet only chooses instances that fall within your budget.
    
4. **Instance Types**: The fleet can include different types of instances based on your requirements, which allows it to be flexible and select the best-performing and most cost-effective instances at the time.
    

### Behavior of Spot Fleets:

- The **Spot Fleet** will automatically launch instances across the specified pools and continuously monitor spot prices and capacity.
- It will **stop launching instances** once the target capacity is met or if it reaches the specified **maximum cost** limit.

### Allocation Strategies:

Spot Fleets offer several strategies to allocate Spot Instances based on different goals (cost, availability, capacity):

1. **lowestPrice**:
    
    - The fleet will always select instances from the pool with the **lowest price**.
    - This is great for **cost optimization** and **short-lived workloads** where availability isn’t as critical, but you want to minimize cost.
2. **diversified**:
    
    - Instances are distributed **evenly across all pools**. This strategy reduces risk by spreading instances across multiple pools.
    - It’s useful for **long-running workloads** where **availability and stability** are critical, as this strategy reduces the chances of interruptions in any single pool.
3. **capacityOptimized**:
    
    - The fleet will select the pool that has the **best capacity** for the number of instances you need. This minimizes the chances of running out of capacity, even if it means paying a higher price.
    - This strategy is ideal when **capacity** is more important than cost, such as for critical workloads that cannot afford interruptions.
4. **priceCapacityOptimized (recommended)**:
    
    - This strategy combines both **capacity** and **cost considerations**. It first selects the pools with the **highest available capacity** to avoid interruptions, and then it chooses from those the pool with the **lowest price**.
    - This is typically the **best choice for most workloads**, as it balances availability and cost.

### How Spot Fleets Work:

1. **Automatic Instance Requests**: Spot Fleets automatically request Spot Instances from your launch pools, based on the allocation strategy you choose.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: It helps ensure you get the **best pricing** possible by either selecting the cheapest or most optimal instances based on your strategy.
3. **Adaptability**: As Spot Instance prices and availability fluctuate, the fleet adapts by rebalancing or launching instances from different pools.
4. **On-Demand Instances**: You can also configure Spot Fleets to use **On-Demand Instances** when Spot Instances are not available or when you need guaranteed capacity.

### Summary:

- **Spot Fleet**: A set of Spot Instances (and optionally On-Demand Instances) that automatically scales to meet your capacity and cost requirements.
- **Launch Pools**: Multiple configurations of instance types, OS, and availability zones, allowing the fleet to choose from the most suitable pool.
- **Strategies**:
    - **lowestPrice** (for cost savings),
    - **diversified** (for stability across pools),
    - **capacityOptimized** (for maximum capacity),
    - **priceCapacityOptimized** (for balancing capacity and cost).
- **Goal**: The Spot Fleet continuously manages resources and adjusts instance allocations to optimize for cost, availability, or capacity as needed.

In essence, **Spot Fleets** simplify the process of acquiring and managing EC2 instances, offering flexibility and cost savings, especially for large-scale or fluctuating workloads.
