[Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)  is an extremely widely-used method of encrypting data, in which anyone can encrypt a message using the public key, but only those who know the private key can decrypt the message. Public-key cryptography is great for keeping data secure because the private key does not need to be shared with parties that only encrypt messages. However, there is one major downside to this type of cryptography: public-key cryptography algorithms are typically slow, making them poorly-suited for encrypting large volumes of data. Because of this, some encryption services place limits on the size of the data you can encrypt — for example, the limit is 4 KB for [AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-encryption.html) .

On the other hand, [symmetric-key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)  algorithms like [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)  — which allow encrypting and decrypting messages using the same key — are much faster. But symmetric encryption schemes can be less secure than public-key schemes because every party that can encrypt messages can also decrypt the messages, since the same key is used for both.


## Introducing Envelope Encryption

What if we could combine the security of public-key cryptography with the performance of symmetric-key cryptography? That's exactly what envelope encryption does.

In envelope encryption, the message is encrypted using a symmetric algorithm and a random key. Then, the random key is encrypted using a public-key algorithm and sent alongside the message in its encrypted form. The only way to decrypt the message itself is to first decrypt the random key, which requires knowledge of the private key.

This clever scheme really delivers the best of both worlds — the private key is still required to decrypt the message, but you only have to run the expensive public-key algorithm on a short cryptographic key instead of on the original message, which could measure in the gigabytes! This makes envelope encryption suitable when the encryption key must be kept secret _and_ the volume of data to encrypt is large. Envelope encryption is also a great approach when the volume of data is a moderate size and must be encrypted and decrypted frequently.

# Envelope Encryption Explained: How It Protects Your Cloud Data

Envelope encryption is a method that significantly enhances the security of your cloud data, essential in today’s digital world where data breaches are increasingly common. This technique involves encrypting a data encryption key (DEK) with another key, the key encryption key (KEK), ensuring an added layer of protection for sensitive information [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption). Notably, major cloud services like Google Cloud implement envelope encryption for data stored at rest, leveraging their internal key management service as a central keystore at the storage layer [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).

This article will delve into the basics of envelope encryption, its key components, and the process involved. We’ll also explore the advantages and challenges of using envelope encryption and consider real-world applications of this critical security measure. By understanding how envelope encryption works, you can better protect your cloud data against potential threats.

# **Understanding the Basics of Envelope Encryption**

## **1) Key Concepts in Envelope Encryption**

**Data Encryption Key (DEK) and Key Encryption Key (KEK)**

1. **DEKs and KEKs**: Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) are used to encrypt data, while Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) are used to encrypt the DEKs themselves [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
2. **Encryption Process**: The DEK is encrypted using the KEK, and this encrypted DEK is then stored alongside the encrypted data [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
3. **Decryption Process**: To access the original data, the encrypted DEK is first decrypted using the KEK. Subsequently, the now plaintext DEK is used to decrypt the data [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).

**Combination of Encryption Methods**

- **Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption**: Envelope encryption utilizes both symmetric (uses the same key for encryption and decryption) and asymmetric encryption (uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption) to leverage the benefits of both security and speed [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69709738/what-is-the-benefit-of-envelope-encryption)[3](https://tryzero.com/blog/envelope-encryption-how-it-works-and-why-we-use-it).

# The Process of Envelope Encryption

## A) Encryption Steps

1. **Data Encryption Key (DEK) Generation**: Initially, generate a DEK locally on your system. This DEK is used to encrypt your data [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
2. **Data Encryption**: Once the DEK is generated, use it to encrypt the data. This process ensures that your data is secured at the point of creation [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
3. **Key Encryption Key (KEK) Generation**: Simultaneously, a new key is generated in Cloud Key Management Service (KMS), which acts as the KEK [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
4. **DEK Encryption**: Use the KEK to encrypt (wrap) the DEK. This step adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that the DEK itself is encrypted with a strong, centrally managed key [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
5. **Storage**: Store both the encrypted data and the wrapped DEK securely. These can be stored alongside each other in the database, ensuring they are ready for secure retrieval when needed [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption)[5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/envelope-encryption/).

## B) Decryption Steps

1. **Retrieval**: When the need to access the original data arises, retrieve both the encrypted data and the wrapped DEK from their storage location [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
2. **DEK Decryption**: Use the KEK stored in Cloud KMS to unwrap (decrypt) the DEK. This step is crucial as it reverts the DEK to its usable form [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
3. **Data Decryption**: With the plaintext DEK, proceed to decrypt the encrypted data. This final step allows you to access the original data in its unencrypted form [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).

## C) Special Considerations for Large Files

- **Direct Encryption Limitation**: AWS Key Management Service (KMS) can directly encrypt files up to 4 KB in size. For files larger than this, envelope encryption becomes necessary [4](https://medium.com/cloudnloud/aws-kms-envelope-encryption-19b70d6e19a5).
- **Efficiency in Large File Encryption**: For larger files, the DEK is encrypted using AWS KMS and then used to encrypt the data locally. This method helps in reducing the network load and avoiding latency since only the smaller DEK needs to be transmitted over the network, rather than the larger data files [4](https://medium.com/cloudnloud/aws-kms-envelope-encryption-19b70d6e19a5)[10](https://www.clouddefense.ai/glossary/aws/envelope-encryption.php).

## Network Efficiency

- **Reduced Network Load**: By encrypting the DEK with KEK locally and only transmitting the DEK over the network, envelope encryption minimizes the amount of sensitive data transmitted, thereby reducing network load and potential latency [4](https://medium.com/cloudnloud/aws-kms-envelope-encryption-19b70d6e19a5).
- **Local Data Key Usage**: The DEK is used locally within the application or encrypting AWS service, which enhances performance and security by limiting the exposure of the encryption keys over the network [4](https://medium.com/cloudnloud/aws-kms-envelope-encryption-19b70d6e19a5).

These steps collectively describe the process of envelope encryption, emphasizing the security measures and efficiencies designed to protect sensitive data in cloud environments.

# Advantages and Challenges

## A) Advantages of Envelope Encryption

## Improved Security and Performance

Envelope encryption enhances security by utilizing both symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods. The data is encrypted quickly using a symmetric algorithm, while the key itself is secured with asymmetric encryption, combining security with efficiency [12](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/key-management-service/umn/faqs/what_are_the_benefits_of_envelope_encryption.html)[11](https://support.huaweicloud.com/eu/dew_faq/dew_01_0054.html). This dual-layer approach not only secures the data but also the keys, offering an additional layer of protection known as “double encryption” [13](https://hackernoon.com/what-the-heck-is-envelope-encryption-in-cloud-security).

## Scalability and Key Management

Managing encryption at scale is streamlined by using a single master key to encrypt multiple DEKs, significantly simplifying key management processes in cloud environments. This method supports scalability by efficiently handling large volumes of data or numerous data files [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption)[17]. AWS KMS further aids this by managing billions of encryption requests, thus providing a scalable and secure key management solution [19].

## Cost-Effectiveness and Compliance

Envelope encryption can be more cost-effective as it reduces the operational overhead associated with key rotations — only the master key needs to be rotated, not the DEKs [16]. Additionally, detailed logs provided by AWS KMS enhance the ability to audit and monitor key usage, helping organizations comply with security policies [18].

## B) Challenges of Envelope Encryption

## Increased Complexity and Computational Requirements

The use of two types of encryption keys (DEKs and KEKs) adds complexity to the encryption process. This complexity can lead to potential key management issues, such as the safe distribution and storage of keys [23]. Moreover, the use of asymmetric encryption increases computational requirements, which could impact system performance [25].

## Key Management and Security Risks

Proper key management is crucial to prevent security breaches. If encryption keys are compromised, it could allow threat actors to access sensitive data [26]. Ensuring that both algorithms used in envelope encryption are strong is vital since the security strength depends on the weaker of the two algorithms used [21].

## Operational Considerations

While envelope encryption simplifies certain aspects of key management, it requires careful implementation to avoid pitfalls such as inadequate access controls or failure to regularly rotate keys. Access control mechanisms must be robust to prevent unauthorized access to encryption keys [18].

# Envelope Encryption in Practice

This hierarchy is designed to ease the management process and is governed by robust Identity and Access Management protocols, ensuring that only authorized users have access to the keys [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).

- **Central Key Management**: Using a central key management service like Cloud KMS or AWS KMS allows for a smaller number of KEKs compared to DEKs, making it easier to manage and encrypt data at scale [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).
- **Protection of Multiple DEKs**: A single KEK can encrypt several DEKs, allowing each data object to have its own DEK without the need to store a large volume of keys [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption).

## D) Enhanced Security Features

The AWS Encryption SDK provides several advanced features to ensure the security and integrity of data:

- **Algorithm Suites**: The default algorithm suite used is AES-GCM with an HMAC-based extract-and-expand key derivation function (HKDF), key commitment, an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature, and a 256-bit encryption key [8](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html).
- **Cryptographic Materials Managers (CMM)**: These managers assemble the cryptographic materials needed to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that all components are securely handled [8](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html).
- **Key Commitment**: This feature guarantees that each ciphertext can only be decrypted to a single plaintext, ensuring that the data key used for encryption is the only key that can decrypt the data [8](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html).
- **Digital Signatures**: To maintain the integrity of digital messages as they are transferred between systems, the AWS Encryption SDK supports digital signatures [8](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html).

## E) Practical Benefits

The implementation of envelope encryption in cloud services offers several practical benefits:

- **Secure Data Sharing**: Envelope encryption allows secure sharing of encrypted data between different parties. Recipients only need the data key to decrypt the data, simplifying the process while maintaining security [14](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-envelope-encryption).
- **Scalability**: By using a central key management service and a hierarchical key structure, envelope encryption supports scalable security solutions that can handle large volumes of data or numerous files efficiently [1](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption)[14](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-envelope-encryption).

By leveraging envelope encryption, cloud providers can offer robust security solutions that protect data at rest and in transit, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure from unauthorized access.
