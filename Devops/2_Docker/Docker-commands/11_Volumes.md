```
docker run --name react-app -v "$(pwd):/app" -v /app/node_modules -p 5173:5173 react-docker
```

or

```
docker run -p 5173:5173 -v "$(pwd):/app" -v /app/node_modules react-docker
```

In Docker, the `-v` option is used to mount volumes, which allows you to link a directory from your local machine (host) to a directory inside the Docker container. This is useful for sharing files between your host machine and the container, so changes made in one location can be reflected in the other.


Let’s break down your specific command:

```
docker run -p 5173:5173 -v "$(pwd):/app" -v /app/node_modules react-docker
```

### Understanding the `-v` Flag in Your Command:

1. **`-v "$(pwd):/app"`**:
    
    - **`$(pwd)`**: This is a shell command that outputs the current working directory on your host machine. The value of `$(pwd)` will be replaced with the full path to the current directory.
    - **`/app`**: This is the target directory inside the Docker container where you want to mount your local directory.
    
    So, `-v "$(pwd):/app"` mounts your current project directory from your host machine into the `/app` directory inside the Docker container.
    
    **Why this is important**:
    
    - This allows you to work on your files locally, but the changes are instantly reflected inside the container. For example, if you modify your React code, it will immediately be available inside the container without needing to rebuild the container.
    - It’s useful for local development because it avoids the need to copy files into the container manually.
2. **`-v /app/node_modules`**:
    
    - This mounts the `node_modules` directory inside the Docker container. However, no corresponding path is provided on the host machine, meaning this is a **"bind mount"** where only the container’s `node_modules` directory is isolated, preventing it from being overwritten by the volume mount from your local machine (`-v "$(pwd):/app"`).
    
    **Why this is important**:
    
    - Normally, when you mount your entire project folder using `-v "$(pwd):/app"`, it would also overwrite the `node_modules` folder inside the container with whatever is in your local project directory. But this isn't always ideal, especially if `node_modules` is different inside the container than on your local machine.
    - By using `-v /app/node_modules`, you ensure that the container keeps its own `node_modules` directory intact, and it's not replaced by the one from your local project. This prevents potential conflicts or missing dependencies, particularly when the container’s environment might be different from your host environment (e.g., different operating system, architecture).

### Summary of What `-v` Does Here:

- `-v "$(pwd):/app"`:
    - Mounts your current working directory from the host machine into the container’s `/app` directory. This allows you to develop on your local machine and see changes immediately reflected in the Docker container.
- `-v /app/node_modules`:
    - Keeps the container’s `node_modules` directory isolated from the local machine to avoid overwriting it with your local `node_modules`. This is crucial because `node_modules` might be different in the container due to differences in the environment (e.g., Linux container vs. your local Windows/Mac machine).

### Practical Use Case:

- You can code on your local machine and see live updates in your Dockerized app without needing to rebuild the container after each change.
- By preserving the container's `node_modules`, you avoid issues with package incompatibilities or platform-specific binaries inside the container.
