### Fundamental period 

he time interval between two waves is known as a Period whereas a function that repeats its values at regular intervals or periods is known as a **Periodic Function**. In other words, a periodic function is a function that repeats its values after every particular interval.

The period of the function is this particular interval mentioned above.

A function f will be periodic with period m, so if we have

**f (a + m) = f (a), For every m > 0.**

It shows that the function f(a) possesses the same values after an interval of “m”. One can say that after every interval of “m” the function f repeats all its values.

**For example –** The sine function i.e. sin a has a period of 2π because 2π is the smallest number for which sin (a + 2π) = sin a, for all a.
