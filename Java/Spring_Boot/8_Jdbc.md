JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases. It provides a standard way to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve results.

### Key Points:

- **Database Access:** JDBC allows you to connect to any relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) using Java.
- **SQL Execution:** You can execute SQL statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` using JDBC.
- **Result Processing:** JDBC provides a way to process the results returned from the database, typically through a `ResultSet`.
- **Driver-Based:** JDBC relies on database-specific drivers to translate Java calls into database-specific commands.

In short, JDBC is a bridge between Java applications and relational databases, enabling seamless data access and manipulation through SQL.
