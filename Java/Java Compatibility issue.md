The versions of `javac` and `java` you're using are mismatched, which can cause issues in your Maven project.

### Explanation:

- **`javac 22.0.2`:** This indicates that your system has the `javac` compiler from JDK 22 installed.
- **`java version "1.8.0_291"`:** This indicates that your system is using the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from Java 8 (version 1.8).

### Why This is a Problem:

- The `javac` command (the Java compiler) is from a much newer version of Java (JDK 22), but the `java` command (used to run Java programs) is from an older version (Java 8). This can lead to compatibility issues because the bytecode generated by `javac` may not be fully compatible with the runtime environment provided by `java` 1.8.
